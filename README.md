# PeakProminence
Compute prominence of all peaks in an elevation map

The prominence calculated by this program follows the definition provided by Wikipedia in page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence: "the minimum height necessary to descend to get from the summit to any higher terrain".

The program reads the elevation map data on the standard input, in the below format:

- Map height (> 0)
- Map width (> 0)
- height*width integer values (may be negative)

This format is the same as the output generated by my ElevationMap program (https://github.com/HoustonWeHaveABug/ElevationMap).

For each peak having a positive prominence, the program will display the below information:

- Peak location and elevation
- Prominence (difference between the peak elevation and the key col elevation)
- Key Col location and elevation (the lowest point on the path between the peak and its ancestor).
- Ancestor location and elevation (the ancestor is defined as the highest peak that can be reached from the key col)

The program is using a "dichotomic BFS" to search for the highest key col that leads to a higher terrain from each peak.
